# Dependencies need to be installed by OS-level admin

## Ubuntu
  git is a good idea:
    * git-core

  Postgres dev files in order to build pg gem
    * libpq-dev

  The capybara webkit driver needs
    * libqtwebkit-dev
  And then you'll need to
    $ DISPLAY=localhost:1.0 xvfb-run bundle exec cucumber
  when running cucumber on headless vm
