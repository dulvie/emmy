Javascript:
  app/view/products/_form.html.haml:
    * need js to show calculated retail price including vat.
      the ex-vat price is what should be saved...?
      or should the retail price saved in db be the inc vat price?
    * a nicer date picker for expire_at and refined_at
      - /products/new (_form)


Rails-side:
  * Add angular javascripts
  * Add breadcrumbs everywhere.
  * Convert all views to haml
    - find app/views/ -type f -name "*.erb"
